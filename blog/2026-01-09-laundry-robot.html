          We don't want your laundry-folding robot that can't fold laundry. Hope
          this helps.
        </h1>
        <p>
          CES used to stand for “Consumer Electronics Show”, but after this
          year's CES, maybe we should think of a new name for the AI slopfest
          and niche-hobby-for-billionaires circlejerk.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did not attend CES—I'd recommending listening to
          <a
            href="https://omny.fm/shows/better-offline/ces-2026-part-seven-thursday"
            >Ed Zitron's podcast</a
          >
          for more information on these topics. I just couldn't bring myself to
          wade through the sea of sycophantic articles from tech journals with
          headlines that straight-up lie about what was on display, so there
          won't be many links or references here.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, being a normal person with a love of consumer electronics, it
          really hit home for me after hearing all of the reports coming out of
          CES 2026 that the big problem with the consumer tech industry (well,
          one of the big problems) is this:
        </p>
        <p>
          We (non-billionaire consumers) don't… really want products, anymore?
        </p>
        <p>Hear me out.</p>
        <p>
          TVs today are huge and paper-thin. They have mind-blowing color
          displays, resolution, and frame rates. We did it, folks. We TV-ed as
          hard as you can TV. You can only make a picture look so good before
          <em>your </em>job, as the tech company creating the medium by which to
          distribute the creative work of others, is over.
        </p>
        <p>
          [George Bush giving a thumbs-up on an aircraft carrier under the
          banner "Mission Accomplished"]
        </p>
        <p>
          But we need to sell new TVs, so we need to convince people that there
          is still something wrong with their current TVs, that this industry is
          “innovating” and worthwhile.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let's slap a chatbot on a television and call it an innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our phones are peak. They're powerful little computers in our pockets
          that can connect us to others instantly no matter where in the world
          we are. There is nothing left for Apple or Android to sell us—<em
            >we've already got what we want. </em
          >Probably the only thing that would get me to buy a new phone (beyond
          planned obsolescence making it necessary) is better battery life. But
          that's not as exciting as when the first iPhone came out. I think
          these companies want to convince us that right now is as exciting a
          time in consumer electronics, and it simply isn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let's slap a chatbot on a phone and call it an innovation. And
          let's convince everyone that they need this new product, that if they
          don't have a chatbot on their phone then do they really have a phone
          at all? Let's also pretend that consumers <em>want </em>to be
          constantly flooded with advertisements tailored to their data
          footprint, that we all haven't noticed that the Internet sucks now,
          Google sucks now, YouTube sucks now, fucking everything sucks now
          because it's all one big ad. Keep pretending that we're stupid.
          That'll go well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sticking with consumer electronics, I really think our homes are as
          automated as we want them to be. No one is excited about a
          laundry-folding robot. Why would I want to “save time” folding laundry
          in my own home if it means I need to break my back at work to afford
          the robot that does the <em>easier, more fulfilling thing? </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Can't you send my robot to work, while I putz around the house doing
          laundry and cooking and reading and making art and sitting outside
          staring at the sky having thoughts both profound and charmingly
          mundane, you know, just generally doing things that make people feel
          good if they have the time and energy to do them?
        </p>
        <p>
          Laundry can be meditative. It connects you to yourself, your home,
          your family. These are the clothes you wear every day. They touch
          nearly every inch of surface area on the largest organ in your body.
          They are some of the most intimate items you can imagine. Everyone
          likes the smell of clean laundry, but you know what's better? The
          smell of a shirt worn recently or often by someone you love.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bad part about laundry isn't doing the laundry. It's having to do
          the laundry after working 40 hours a week (if you're lucky), after
          paying the bills, after getting off the phone with the health
          insurance company denying your prescriptions, after being abused by a
          company that can fire anyone at any time for no reason with impunity,
          after watching your 401k disappear because some fuckhead is playing
          chicken with the stock market, after scrolling through social media
          and seeing a mother murdered by a death squad in this country you've
          always been told is the best in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all of that, laundry can feel like
          <em>just one thing too fucking far. </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          But products can't solve those other problems. No tech company can
          make a product that stops children from being gunned down in the
          classroom. (Though we've tried—check out the charming trend of
          bulletproof backpacks.) No product will ensure you and your family
          have access to doctors and medications—but we can make a chatbot that
          will spit out randomly-generated garbage that looks sort of like
          medical advice! No product will strengthen labor laws to protect you
          from being fired at a whim. No product will make you feel like things
          are worthwhile and okay when they're not. (I mean, maybe heroin,
          temporarily. Have we tried that yet?)
        </p>
        <p>
          But hey. Maybe we can make a robot that at the very least folds your
          child's laundry. So then, instead of <em>you </em>pulling the Paw
          Patrol-brand pajama shirt out of the dryer, holding it in your hands,
          remembering when you bought it or someone gave it to you at your
          future kid's baby shower, feeling the fabric that gets rougher with
          every wash but your kid still loves the thing, damn it, and what an
          amazing kid they are that they can love something so simple no matter
          its flaws—
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of that, we can burn money and carbon trying to build a
          machine that will think and feel none of those things, taking your
          place in your home while you spend more time on the screens that are
          giving you psychosis and all the while you continue to work, and work,
          and fucking work. You're more productive than ever, but your workload
          and hours and salary never seem to reflect that—and this is apparently
          a future we're supposed to be excited about.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can hear some of you now. “But what about people with disabilities!”
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, I think it's pretty disgusting that people are suddenly
          using this as a rallying cry to justify use of technology that has
          shown absolutely <em>no evidence</em> of assisting disabled people.
          All of you who pull this half-baked argument out of your back pocket
          whenever someone insults your favorite widdle toy should be ashamed.
          You're just throwing darts in the dark trying to strike something that
          might one day be sort-of true—but is just as likely to be the exact
          <em>opposite </em>of helpful and assistive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did anyone <em>ask </em>a disabled person if something like a
          laundry-folding robot would help them? Do they <em>want </em>a stupid,
          massive, heavy, expensive, fragile robot that will take years to come
          to production, if ever, that right now can only do things like take a
          towel out of the dryer and try to fold it for seven minutes and only
          get partway there? What is the use case? What parts of the laundry
          process are difficult for people with different disabilities (they're
          not a monolith), and what is the most efficient and useful way to
          address them while preserving human dignity and foregrounding the
          aspects of the process that are fulfilling, worthwhile, good for us?
        </p>
        <p>
          (Not that I'm trying to like, <em>sanctify </em>laundry. You can hate
          laundry. If you do, you probably also hate the laundry-folding robot,
          which as of right now does not fold laundry.)
        </p>
        <p>
          If I had to pull something out of my ass, I'd think one option would
          look more like a laundry machine or dryer with some kind of extended
          chute for people with limited mobility, so they don't have to be as
          tall or reach as far or have as much dexterity or grip strength to
          perform the task.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is the actual barrier? It's not just “laundry”. I don't know if
          it's cool to look at a group of people and say “You <em>can't </em>do
          laundry anymore at all. You're welcome. Nobel Prize, please.”
        </p>
        <p>
          [GIF of Stephen Colbert on the Colbert Show saying "Nobel Prize
          please"]
        </p>
        <p>
          Ugh. I am not qualified to speak any further on that, so we'll move
          on.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is especially infuriating because there are legitimate avenues of
          research and experimentation in the tech world that would actually
          help people. I have Type 1 diabetes—maybe one of you guys with all the
          money could improve my CGM so it stops giving me false lows and false
          highs, stops crapping out altogether, isn't a huge plastic disc I have
          to shoot into my arm every 10 days that gives me a rash from the
          adhesive and ruins pictures where I wear short sleeves?
        </p>
        <p>
          But while that would technically be a product, it's not one that can
          be marketed to everyone, from toddlers to grandparents, it's not
          something that you can convince the general public they simply cannot
          do without, and so medical tech limps along (in the United States at
          least, take a look at China and Japan if you think medical innovations
          have stalled worldwide) while companies that are somehow “worth”
          hundreds of billions of dollars while also being hundreds of billions
          in debt fire their engineers and developers and coders, try to sell us
          a shit product made of shit that does shit-all, and make
          <em>us </em>feel crazy for not wanting it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that I write this, I'm shocked they haven't tried to shove an LLM
          into my continuous glucose monitor. Oh god, that's next, isn't it?
        </p>
        <p>
          A quote attributed to the Marxist philosophers Frederic Jameson and
          Slavoj Žižek states:<strong> “</strong>It's easier to imagine the end
          of the world than the end of capitalism.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that's where we are, now more than ever. Capitalism isn't
          <em>doing anything for us</em>, and we refuse to acknowledge it.
          Infinite growth is a lie. There comes a certain point when products
          and services can't really get any better—but you can't have that
          plateau line in your company books, even though to any sane person it
          would signal success.
        </p>
        <p>
          We simply cannot fucking conceive of a world where we aren't plagued
          by advertisements and data miners, where we don't have to worry about
          making something profitable but instead just making something
          <em>good</em>. Even when it's staring us in the face! Even when
          average consumers are confused about what the hell we're supposed to
          be doing with these shitty apps!
        </p>
        <p>
          We started off killing the planet to make things we needed. Now we're
          killing the planet just for the fucking hell of it, I guess, for
          something hardly any of us want or have any use for that doesn't
          actively make the world a worse place.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't know. Maybe we don't need a CES next year—it feels like
          they've taken the “consumer” out of “consumer electronics”. None of
          this crap is for us. It never will be again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've gotta sign off—I've got laundry to fold. Man, I sure wish I had a
          shitty robot to do it shittily instead. And maybe a shitty robot to
          write my Substack posts, again shittily, so I could then presumably go
          do… Whatever the fuck is left for humans to do.
